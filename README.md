# Introduction to Deep Learning, Final Project

Final Project for the course *LDA-T3114 Introduction to Deep Learning (2019)* at the University of Helsinki.

The project aims to replicate the encoder-decoder recurrent neural network system described by Kann and Sch√ºtze (2016) (https://aclanthology.org/W16-2010/) for the SIGMORPHON 2016 Shared Task (https://aclanthology.org/W16-2002/). The data used in training and evaluating the model can be downloaded from https://github.com/ryancotterell/sigmorphon2016/tree/master/data/. However, to make the project a bit more manageable, we were instructed to work only on three languages from the original data: Finnish, German, and Navajo. More information on the project can be read in the final project report, included in this repository as a PDF file.
